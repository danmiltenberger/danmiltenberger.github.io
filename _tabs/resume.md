### More Details
##### Aerosols in Medicine Lab - VCU
I'm currently working part time in this laboratory which is working on better ways to disperse surfactant to the lungs. You can find an overview of the lab from vcu news,  [VCU Researchers Developing Affordable Noninvasive Treatment for RDS in newborns](https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-researchers-developing-affordable-noninvasive-treatment-for-rds-in-newborns).

Day to day, I'm printing the same part using different printer settings and testing particle dispersion using an anderson cascade impacter. From there, I analyze the data using a UV visualizer to find the particle concentration. The hopeful goal is to publish this work and help set a new standard of 3D printing for aerosolized medicine. I'm learning how to stay organized while creating custom fixtures and tooling to improve my personal efficiency.

##### Volvo - Mack Trucks
I worked as an industrial engineering intern at Mack’s Lehigh Valley Operations. I worked for the logistics department and helped ensure that all 120 trucks / day had the right parts at the right time. I learned python during my first few weeks and used my programming knowledge to build an RPA and automate over 300 hours of repetitive tasks, saving the department an estimated $40,000 per year. It was a major morale boost too.

Hundreds of small pallets were “double parked” in the main logistics warehouse in the plant. I did an in depth analysis of the storage issues and created a PowerBI to show that the plant was wasting over 300 pallet slots every day. Based on the data in my report, the material handling department will likely implement a plan to reorganize the warehouse and save $648,000 per year.

I had the opportunity to help lead a cross functional team in the plant to improve the first 5 stations of the main assembly line, where I worked closely with technicians from UAW local #677, and engineers from maintenance, production, and continuous improvement. I designed a 3D printed fixture to securely hold power steering valves onto a table next to the line. This fixture stopped mission critical parts from breaking before they could be installed.

Near the end of my internship the plant shut down for 2 weeks. With the down time I developed a program which would automatically create station drawings, instead of them being done manually. This program will save the production team over 400 hours/year and the diagrams will be installed across all 200+ storage racks in the plant. This is expected to save $23,000. This project wasn’t assigned to me; I recognized a need and impressed my department with the finished product. If you'd like to learn more, I wrote a blog post all about the project [Draw Bot - My Coolest Project So Far]([url](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/DRAW-BOT-OVERVIEW/)).

##### VCU Libraries - The Workshop
I helped hundreds of patrons with complicated troubleshooting to make sure that their projects got completed. I taught students and faculty principles of 3D printing and laser cutting in weekly orientations.
