I'm Dan Miltenberger, a masters student in mechanical engineering at University of Colorado Boulder. I specialize in mechanical design, programming, CAD, and mathematics. I'm eager to contribute to medical device development, with an emphasis on active devices like surgical robotics. I want to be an engineer that helps design a better future. I'm currently looking for a summer 2026 internship in medical engineering. Please take a look at my resume, portfolio, and feel free to reach out at my email below. 

Best! <br>
