## Hello!

I'm Dan Miltenberger, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm a current senior and I'll be graduating May 2025. I'm a Tau Beta Pi scholar with a GPA of 3.8. 

I'm currently looking for a full time job in the medical device industry, with an emphasis on active devices like surgical robotics. I want to be an engineer that helps design a better future. 

I'm currently assisting research in the _Gates Foundation_ funded Aerosols in Medicine (AIM) Lab, working to improve the efficiency of a device to administer powderized surfactant, which helps preterm infants breath. This semester I'm using CT scans, MRI imaging software, and programming to combine data into custom curves to optimize performance. If all goes well, I'll write a post about it soon - though feel free to ask about it during an interview! 

Summer 2025, I worked as an OEM Product Developement Intern at B. Braun Medical Inc. I developed 3D models and VBA programs to improve testing of medical devices in a regulated industry. Day to day, I communicated with customers, technicians, and subject matter experts on testing procedures. My main priorities were coordinating project timelines and deliverables such as tests and quotes. 

Summer 2024, I was an industrial engineering intern at Mack Trucks (Volvo Group). I got to walk along an active assembly line (120 trucks a day) and help improve the logistics department. Through different robotic process automations (RPA)s, I eliminated 700 hours of tedious work and saved $40,000.  

For the past 3 years I've been working at my school's makerspace "The Workshop" where I have taught over 200 people how to use 3D printers and lasercutters in weekly orientations. I've developed my skills in customer service adn technical troubleshooting. When I'm not studying on the quiet floor of the library you can find me running on the capital trail, biking to class, and playing dungeons & dragons with my friends.            

## Please take a look at some of my projects! 

An example of my 3D modeling, teamwork and communication skills is in the [Rxit Pill Dispenser](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/PILL-PEZ-DISPENSER/), which won first place in my Mechanical Systems Design class. 

An example of my programming and independent problem solving is [DrawBot](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/DRAW-BOT-OVERVIEW/), a program which automated logistics diagrams at Mack. It saved money, time, and made a lot of people really happy. 

If my experience and portfolio sound interesting to you, please consider taking a look at my [resume pdf](/assets/images/Dan Miltenberger Resume Fall 2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
