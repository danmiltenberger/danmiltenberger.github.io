## Hello!

I'm Dan Miltenberger, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm a current senior and I'll be graduating May 2025. I'm a Tau Beta Pi scholar with a GPA of 3.8. 

I'm currently looking for a full time job in the medical device industry, with an emphasis on active devices like surgical robotics. I want to be an engineer that helps design a better future. Please consider taking a look at my resume here: [Dan Miltenberger Resume Fall 2024](/assets/images/Dan Miltenberger Resume Fall 2024.pdf){:target="_blank"}. If you would like to learn more about my work and projects, please consider checking the [resume tab](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/resume/) which provides more information. 

I'm currently assisting research in the _Gates Foundation_ funded Aerosols in Medicine (AIM) Lab, working to improve the powder dispersion of infant surfactant, which helps babies breath. This semester I'm working on a new way of drawing the geometry of the bottom of the powder chamber, using CT scans, MRI imaging software, and custom programming to combine data into custom curves to optimize performance. If all goes well, I'll write a post about it soon - though feel free to ask about it during an interview! 

Last summer, I worked as an OEM Product Developement Intern at B. Braun Medical Inc. I developed 3D models and VBA programs to improve testing of medical devices in a regulated industry. Day to day, I communicated with customers, technicians, and subject matter experts on testing procedures. My main priorities were coordinating project timelines and deliverables such as tests and quotes. 

The summer before, I was an industrial engineering intern at Mack Trucks (Volvo Group). I got to walk along an active assembly line (120 trucks a day) and help improve the logistics department. Through different robotic process automations (RPA)s, I eliminated 700 hours of tedious work and saved $40,000.  

For the past 3 years I've been working at my school's makerspace "The Workshop" where I taught over 200 people how to use 3D printers and lasercutters in weekly orientations. When I'm not studying on the quiet floor of the library you can find me running on the capital trail, biking to class, and playing dungeons & dragons with my friends.            

Please take a look at some of my projects! A recent one is the [Rxit Pill Dispenser](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/PILL-PEZ-DISPENSER/), which won first place in my mechanical systems design class. A favorite project from Mack is [DrawBot](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/DRAW-BOT-OVERVIEW/), which automated logistics diagrams (and made a lot of people really happy). You can find an overview of my work on the [resume tab](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/resume/).
