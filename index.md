## HI!

I'm Dan Miltenberger, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm a current junior and I'll be graduating May 2025. 

I'm currently looking for a Summer 2024 internship or Co-Op in the medical device industry. I want to be an engineer that helps as many people as possible; I want to help design a better future. 

Currently I'm assisting research in VCU's Aerosols in Medicine Lab, working with formlab resin printers to improve powder dispersion. Over the summer I was an industrial engineering intern at Mack Trucks (Volvo Group). I got to walk along an active assembly line (120 trucks a day) and help improve the logistics department. I eliminated 700 hours of tedious work and saved $40,000. I also wrote an algorithm that analyzed how pallets in a plant warehouse were stored. Following my report's recommendations, the team could save $648,000 a year in storage space.

When I'm not studying on the quiet, quiet floor of the library you can find me running on the Capital Trail, biking to class, and playing dungoens & dragons with my friends.
