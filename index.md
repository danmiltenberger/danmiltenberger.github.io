## Hi!

I'm Dan Miltenberger, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm a current senior and I'll be graduating May 2025. 

I'm currently looking for a full time job in the medical device industry, with an emphasis on active devices like surgical robotics. I want to be an engineer that helps design a better future. 

Currently I'm assisting research in VCU's Aerosols in Medicine Lab, working with formlab resin printers to improve powder dispersion. Last summer, I worked as an OEM Product Developement Intern at B. Braun Medical Inc. I developed 3D models and VBA programs to improve testing of medical devices in a regulated industry. 
Day to day, I communicated with customers, technicians, and subject matter experts on testing procedures. My main priorities were coordinating project timelines and deliverables such as tests and quotes

The summer before, I was an industrial engineering intern at Mack Trucks (Volvo Group). I got to walk along an active assembly line (120 trucks a day) and help improve the logistics department. I eliminated 700 hours of tedious work and saved $40,000. I also wrote an algorithm that analyzed how pallets in a plant warehouse were stored. Following my report's recommendations, the team could save $648,000 a year in storage space. For the past 3 years I've been working at my school's makerspace "The Workshop" where I taught over 200 people how to use 3D printers and lasercutters in weekly orientations.

When I'm not studying on the quiet floor of the library you can find me running on the capital trail, biking to class, and playing dungeons & dragons with my friends.            

Please take a look at some of my projects! My personal favorite is [DrawBot](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/DRAW-BOT-OVERVIEW/), which automated logistics diagrams (and made a lot of people really happy). You can find an overview of my work on the [resume tab](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/resume/). If you would like to reach out please do so through my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-miltenberger/) or my school email miltenbergerd@vcu.edu. Thanks!
