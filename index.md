title: "Engineering A Better Future"
date: 2025-01-26

## Hello!

I'm Dan Miltenberger, a mechanical engineering student at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). I'm graduating May 2025 and currently looking for a full time job in the medical device industry, with an emphasis on active devices like surgical robotics. I want to be an engineer that helps design a better future. Please check out my [resume (PDF)](/assets/images/Dan Miltenberger Resume Fall 2024.pdf){:target="_blank"} or continue scrolling for a more conversational explanation of my education, experience, and projects. I like to describe myself as an individual that goes above and beyond, like coding my own website (if you're reading this it's working!) or building a working prototype even when it wasn't part of the assignment. If that sounds interesting to you, please reach out through danmiltenberger25@gmail.com

Best!
Dan 

## Education
### Virginia Commonwealth University
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Minor in Mathematics

I take my academics seriously! I'm proud of a 3.82 GPA, being a member of the Dean's List, and a Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honors Society Scholar. During my senior year I pitched a custom project for my senior capstone, and I am honing the skill (art?) of project management as the team lead, with the invaluable help of my teammates and faculty advisors. Funny story - the pitch for a "low cost clinical spirometer for developing communities" was so popular that the project was split into two teams (a first for the college of engineering). This means that we're the first team ever to be competing against... ourselves? 

## Experience
### R&D / OEM Product Development Intern
B. Braun Medical Inc. (May to August 2024)

In the OEM / Internation divison, we worked like our own company where our clients were other medical device manufactuers. I learned how to contribute to over 10 different projects at different stages of development, keeping organized and communicating effectively across many departments. I worked closely with techincians in the testing lab, quality engineers, manufacturing engineers, sales, and customers. A typical day ranged from joining a customer call in the morning and touring a sterilization chamber in the afternoon. I gained a whole picture view of medical device development from an industry perspective, including working with FDA and MDA regulations, good documentation practices, rapid aging and sterilization, and more. 

I led an IV spike validation project for a client from start to finish. I researched previous testing procedures, checked my work with technicians and engineers, sourced the parts, and handled problems as they arose. One component of the spike puncture test had a tedious data analysis portion which took at least an hour per batch. I wrote a data analysis tool in VBA to automate this process, saving at least 20 hours of work. I also designed a fixture for the test to improve ergonomics. I regularly updated the client with progress updates. This was an invaluable experience in learning how to communicate effectively and occasionally give "bad news." I learned to lead with honesty and to be transparent, and everything would work out. 

### Undergraduate Research Assistant
Aerosols in Medicine Lab (September 2023 to Present)

Iâ€™m currently working part time in Dr. Worth Longest's lab under Dr. Casey Grey to help [develop an affordable noninvasive treatment for RDS in newborns](https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-researchers-developing-affordable-noninvasive-treatment-for-rds-in-newborns). Last semester I wrote a custom program to transform CT images into custom geometry shapes to hopefully improve powder efficiency. The semester before, I tested resin printing parameters and orientations to determine optimal print settings to increase consistency across multiple distinct projects in the lab. I learned how to stay focused, organized, and most critically ask for help in a changing and new laboratory environment.


### Industrial Engineering Intern
Mack Trucks, part of Volvo Group (May to August 2023)

I worked as an intern in the logistics division of Mack Truck's Lehigh Valley Operations. I got to walk along an active assembly line (120 trucks a day) and help improve the logistics department. People love hearing about engineers getting their hands dirty - well let me tell you, I got dirty. Part of my job was checking that parts were in the right location, which meant picking through part bins covered in soot and oil. I just rolled up my sleeves!

Over the summer I taught myself to program in Python, and then immediately found a dozen ways that my coding ability could improve efficiency. Through different robotic process automations (RPA)s, I eliminated 700 hours of tedious work and saved $40,000. I also co-lead a [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) with the logistics and manufacturing department to improve the efficiency and ergonomics of 5 assembly line stations. 

### Makerspace Student Worker
James Branch Cabell Library (August 2021 to Present)

For the past 3.5 years I've been working at my school's makerspace "The Workshop" where I have taught over 300 people how to use 3D printers and lasercutters in weekly orientations. I've developed my skills in customer service and technical troubleshooting.           

## Projects

### Breathe Easy
My senior design project, stay tuned!

### Mountain Range
I built a custom program to convert CT scanned capsule shaped containers into custom geometries optimized for distinct powders.

### Rxit Pill Dispenser
An example of my 3D modeling, teamwork and communication skills is in the [Rxit](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/Rxit_pill_dispenser/), which won first place in my Mechanical Systems Design class. 


### DrawBot
An example of my programming and independent problem solving is [DrawBot](https://danmiltenberger.github.io/posts/drawbot/), a program which automated logistics diagrams at Mack. It saved money, time, and made a lot of people really happy.
