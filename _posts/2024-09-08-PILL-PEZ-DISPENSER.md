Mechanical Systems Design (MSD) had one of the coolest culminating projects. "Design something to help people, with an emphasis on recycled materials." The example in class was creating an adapter to use bicycle wheels on a wheelchair. 

Our team focused on the task of taking medication, and I'm glad we did. It was not required, or expected, that we would create an actual model. Not only did we do that, we built a model that worked! I can still remember the shift in the room when we showed the working version in the video. I also still have the 3D printed version on my desk, next to a container of the "pills" which are in fact just tic-tacs. 

I'm happy to say that we won first place in a landslide and quite literally got a 110% grade on the project. (90%, and then 20 bonus from all of the votes). 

I recently found out that Dr. Costano showed this video to the next class in MSD, just like how he showed an example video to our class at the start of the project. I'm glad that we got to build a working version, and even more glad that others can be inspired by the teams hard work and determination. 
	
Without further ado, please check out the video!
