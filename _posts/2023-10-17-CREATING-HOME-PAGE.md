I’m Dan, a mechanical engineering student at VCU in beautiful Richmond Virginia. I’m looking for a Summer 2024 internship or Co-Op helping design medical devices.

If you’re considering me as an intern, please check out my warehouse analysis program I wrote for Mack Trucks. Expected savings of about $650,000 a year, though the program hasn’t been adapted yet. Also, check out my Draw Bot project where I used everything I learned over a summer to automate 500 hours of work away.

I have experience with research, programming, and working along assembly lines and regulated industries. Please check out some of my projects or my blog, where I write about stuff I wish I knew a couple years ago.

I love to learn! I taught myself (well, youtube taught me) how to program and I was able to put this site together! If a page doesn’t load right, well, it’s part of the learning experience.
